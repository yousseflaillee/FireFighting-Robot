# Fire Fighting Robot 🚒🤖

An Arduino-based project designed to detect and extinguish fire using sensors, actuators, and motor control.

## 📌 Project Overview
This robot can detect fire using a flame sensor and automatically move towards it. Once close enough, it activates a water pump (or fan) to extinguish the fire.  
This project was developed as a **final project** during the RPM Robotics Course 2024 at Nile University.

## 🛠️ Components Used
- Arduino Uno
- Flame Sensor
- Ultrasonic Sensor (for obstacle avoidance)
- DC Motors + L298N Motor Driver
- Servo Motor
- Water Pump with Relay
- LCD Display (I2C)

## ⚡ Features
- Flame detection and localization  
- Automatic navigation towards the fire  
- Fire extinguishing mechanism using pump/servo system  
- Obstacle detection with ultrasonic sensors  
- Status display on LCD  

## 🖥️ Tools & Skills
- **Arduino IDE** (Embedded C programming)  
- **Proteus** (Circuit simulation)  
- **SolidWorks** (Robot mechanical design)  

## 📂 Repository Contents
- `FireFightingRobot.ino` → Arduino source code  

## 🚀 How It Works
1. Flame sensor detects fire direction.  
2. Motors navigate the robot towards the fire.  
3. Ultrasonic sensor avoids obstacles.  
4. Pump/servo activates to extinguish the fire.
